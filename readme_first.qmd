# What do you need installed?

We will use R to call the functions to fit continuous psychophysics models. However, since the functions we will be calling are written in C++, we will need to compile the file *cpsyKalman.cpp* located in the cpp folder.

In order to compile this file, you need the packages `reticulate`, `Rcpp` and `RccpArmadillo`.


In order to use RccpArmadillo and compile *cpsyKalman.cpp* you will need an R installation which is able to compile c++ programs.

```{r}

if(!("Rcpp" %in% (.packages()))){
  require(Rcpp)
  require(RcppArmadillo)
}

sourceCpp("./cpp/cpsyKalman.cpp")


```

If you got no complaints in the last chunk you're ready to go!

If you encounter difficulties, probably you need some compilers tools (e.g. Rtools or a fortran installation to run RccpArmadillo).

Just come to see me if you get stuck!
